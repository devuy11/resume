{\bf Definite and Indefinite Summation of Hypergeometric Series}\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\textit{Summer Project under Prof. Satyadev NandaKumar\hfill May'13-June'13}
\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{itemize}
\item{
Studied and Implemented Gosper's Algorithm which either returns indefinte summation of hypergeometric series if it exists otherwise tells us that the closed form does not exists.Implementation was done in Mathematica 9.
}
\item{
Studied Sister Celine's Algorithm which gives definite summation of proper hypergeometric series.
}
\item{
Studied and Implemented Zeilberger's Algorithm which gives definite summation of proper hypergeometric series.This Algorithm is more efficient than Sister Celine's Algorithm in computing the definite summation of the series.Implementation was done in Mathematica 9.
}
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{itemize}
\item{
Built an income tax system.
}
\item{
It is possible that a person can tell itâ€™s wrong salary at some time , then when we get to know his correct salary , we update our database without losing the value which we already had in the database. This database can be used to track persons who tell most lies, track in-come tax paid by the person and many more interesting things.
